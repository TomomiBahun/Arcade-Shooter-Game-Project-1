# Arcade-Shooter-Game-Project-1

This project is continued from Project 0. An improved design pattern is used in this project, specifically making use of object-oriented-design methods.
Playable with a computer keyboard (move with direction keys, shot bullets with space key, enable slow-move mode with Left Shit key), but still in progress.
